
All Software for the Bird Behavior Exhibit:

1) User Web Pages (Ben Schell)
2) Image Processing Program (Peter Reintjes)
3) Button Control (Perl script, Peter Reintjes)

This project also uses FWink (binary dist), but
may eventually use FWink as a compiled-in library.

Just to see if I can add this in Eclipse ( using Egit )
I had to clone the repository using https (which won't
work for push).

No! It does work for PUSH.  Damn it.  SSH works
and HTTPS doesn't for a Linux Client.  HTTPS works
and SSH doesn't for a Windows XP Client.  
I actually think they might both work for Windows 7,
but I have to go back and check. Sheesh.
I will push this change via HTTPS (windows xp).

Now it seems to be the opposite.
